		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Biggest challenge was just understanding what each line of code did and why it's important for the function to work.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I ran into a technical problem where my JavaScript wasn't showing up in my HTML file on Browser. Tried to find whatever I may have missed, even looking at the main HTML file. Finally, I found out that one of the lines had brackets instead of parenthesis.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here are the results of my JavaScript code:</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Script Output</h2>
        <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
    </div>
