		<h1>Challenges/Problems</h1>
		<p>It was a bit of a challenge to come up with a pseudocode but me and my partner were able to figure it out. We were a bit confused on what to do for some things, but we worked togethe to figure it out.</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<h2>Task 1: How to Make a Painting</h2>
		<p>
			<li>Grab paintbrush</li>

			<li>Clean painbrush</li>

			<li>Dispense desired paint onto palette</li>

			<li>Dip brush in paint</li>

			<li>Apply paint to canvas</li>

			<li>Create desired image</li>

			<li>Rinse off brush with water</li>

		</p>

		<h2>Task 2: Creating a Math Calculation Program</h2>
		<p>
			<li>Create area for user to input two numbers</li>
				<ul>
				<p><li>Code in places where the user will input</li></p>

				<p><li>Link them created GUIs</li></p>
				</ul>

			<li>Create options for whether the user wants to add, subtract, multiply, or divide their numbers</li>
				<ul>
				<p><li>Put each of the options under a list with selectable inputs</li></p>
				</ul>
			<li>Make “if” statements based on which option user selects</li>

			<li>Code in a Calculate button</li>
				<ul>
				<p><li>Create a GUI for it</li></p>
				</ul>
			<li>Test to see if program works properly</li>
				<ul>
				<p><li>Try it using all four different variations</li></p>
				<p><li>Try it using all four different variations</li></p>
				</ul>
		</ol>
