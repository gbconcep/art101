		<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The biggest challenge was figuring out how to properly combine Lab 7's code with the new code. I was primarily basing the code off of the Fiddle work we did in Lecture on Thursday. Thankfully my partner and I worked out what worked and what didn't.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Had a few errors when going testing out the HTML file, mostly when it came to outputting the right results. This time I used the console log way more often to check my code.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is the code:</p>
    What is your name?
    <input type=text id="my_input">
    <button id="my_button">
    Press Me.
    </button>
    <div id = output>
    </div>
    </div>
</body>
