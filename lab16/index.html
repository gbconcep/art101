		<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I was a bit confused at the Task 2 link due to how it was worded but overall it was pretty simple due to its similarities to Lab 15 with the main hurdle being how necessary the extension ended up being.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>At first it wasn't working, even with the extension installed before we realized that I had to manually add the extension on the webpage.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Use extension to activate: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf/related?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon</p>
