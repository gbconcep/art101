		<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The main challenge was learning how to properly test the APIs and put the output of the AJAX call in output div.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The problem my partner and I faced was not getting the API from the button. Took us a while to figure out how to either parse or convert our data into a string. Eventually we were able to figure out some way using elements from the stuff we did in lecture.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is the code:</p>

    <button id = "activate">
      Activate
    </button>

    <div id = "output">
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
